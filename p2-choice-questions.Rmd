# Great work! 
Now that you've shared a bit about yourself, we'd like you to consider a shopping scenario in which you can choose some apples to purchase from a set of apples with different attributes.
Let's learn about these attributes:

### Price
refers to the price to buy this car

### Mileage
It refers to how much the car has been driven

### Model Year
It is the year when car was manufactured

### Brand
Shows the brand of this car

### Range
Its the number of miles a car can drive in one complete charge.

### Warranty
Is whether the car comes with a warranty or not

### Charging Station
Is whether dealer offers a free home charging port when you buy the car

### Fast Recharge
This entails that the car can be charged faster than its normal charging time

We'll now begin the choice tasks. On the next few pages we will show you three options of apples and we'll ask you to choose the one you most prefer. 

For example, if these were the only apples available, which would you choose?

[mc_button type question with the following three options]

# Great work!

We will now show you 8 sets of choice questions starting on the next page.

[mc_button type question with the following three options]

(1 of 8) If these were your only options, which would you choose?

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
